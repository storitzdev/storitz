1) Install Grails 1.2.3.
   Grails 1.3.2 will work too.  Omit spring-security-core below and use IntelliJ 9.0.3+ (currently EAP Maia).

2) Check out project from SVN.

3) CD to the project dir.

4) Install the following plugins:

grails install-plugin spring-security-core
grails install-plugin http://storitz-files.s3.amazonaws.com/grails-image-tools-1.0.5-SNAPSHOT.zip
#grails install-plugin http://www.arquetipos.co.cr/blog/files/grails-image-tools-1.0.4.zip
grails install-plugin rest
grails install-plugin ws-client
grails install-plugin fckeditor
grails install-plugin quartz
grails install-plugin authorize-net
grails install plugin jms
grails install-plugin dynamic-jasper
grails install-plugin sanitizer
# Choose sanitation level?  I used 3 (loose - MySpace).

I (JPW) had a problem with Grails 1.2.4 failing to run-app with compilation errors complaining about JQuery classes.  Appears to be related to <http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILSPLUGINS-2513>.  I downgraded JQuery thusly:

grails install-plugin jquery 1.4.2.5
grails install-jquery

Following a 'grails upgrade', it is not necessary to install plugins manually.  A subsequent 'run-app' or such will automatically install them.
