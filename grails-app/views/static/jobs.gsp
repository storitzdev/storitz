        <h1>Careers at Storitz</h1>

        <p>
          We're searching for some great technical folks to join the Storitz team.  Storitz uses state of the art technology to
          build out the site and need people who eat, breathe and sleep Groovy/Grails, jQuery, CSS, MySQL and Linux. We leverage
          technology to highly automate our industry and need sharp technical people want to apply technology to solve a lot of
          tough problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are located in West Los Angeles right off the 405 Freeway.  Our offices are a short walk to 20 or 30 restaurants. We have
          a great group of people and would love energized, talented folks to email a resume and cover letter to <a href="mailto:jobs@storitz.com">jobs@storitz.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the rapidly changing nature of a startup, all positions are onsite - we are not yet ready to accommodate remote or telecommuting employees.
        </p>
        <h2>Senior Software Engineer</h2>
        <p>
          A senior engineer/team lead will become the right hand man for the CTO.  This position is 90% hands on development for large portions of the site functionality.  10% of time
          will be devoted to mentoring and other duties.  A strong candidate will have a background in data driven website design, proficiency in the tools of the trade
          and have a strong technical and theoretical background in CS.  Storitz uses Groovy/Grails technology, so a good candidate will have some experience with Groovy/Grails
          and a good background in Java technologies.  String OOAD skills and the ability to implement designed functionality with a minimum amount
          of handholding is a must.  Candidate must also be a quick learner - we leverage as much as we can, so knowledge of popular libraries, plugins and open source tools
          is a definite plus.
