      <h1>Storitz Supports</h1>

      <p>
        Storitz knows that there is more to running a business than an awesome looking website and a blank space for your credit card number.  We want to do good in every sense of the phrase.
        That’s why it’s important to us and to our company to give back to our community.  This community includes our clients, our customers and our employees.
        In this spirit, Storitz has teamed with local and national organizations to contribute to causes we believe in.
        We continue to seek new organizations to support both as a company and as individuals.  For more information about Storitz as a corporate sponsor,
        send us an <g:link controller="contactUs" action="create">email</g:link>.
