  <h1>About us</h1>

  <h2><a name="team">The Storitz Team</a></h2>

  <p>The Storitz Team is made up of talented, passionate and dedicated who are committed to our company, to our customers and to our
  clients.  If you want to know a little bit more about who we are and what we're all about, keep reading...</p>

  <h3>Adrian Comstock</h3>
  <p>After 16 years in real estate and technology businesses, and then carefully watching the convergence of Internet technology with 
  offline businesses, it became apparent to Adrian Comstock that Storitz needed to be created.  A California native with a degree in 
  Philosophy and Russian language from the University of Southern California, Adrian knew that he was the obvious choice for the job.  
  Well, maybe not so obvious.  But after spending seven years as a director at The Magellan Group, working tirelessly for their self 
  storage operations, as well as his previous experience as CEO of DriveGear.com, he knew that he had both the self storage industry 
  experience and the startup determination to build a useful and invaluable website and has set out to do just that.   Adrian has been 
  fortunate enough to be able to surround himself with a brilliant and dedicated team who all bring important elements to the big red 
  table where Storitz has its team meetings: both personally and professionally.  Though each day at a startup presents new challenges, 
  the Storitz employees constantly surprise him with their ingenuity and efforts to solve problems, work together and ultimately create 
  the best user experience possible.</p>


  <h3>Charlie Hornberger</h3>
  <p>A near-native of California, Charlie lives in the zany, lovable, historic Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.  Before joining Storitz,
  he headed up the product development team at AT&T Interactive, publishers of yellowpages.com and the country's biggest local online ad 
  network, where they built the external-facing web sites, mobile apps and APIs that powered nearly $1B of annual digital advertising revenue. 
  As the CTO at Storitz, he sets the company's technology strategy, manages the product development team, writes code, and fixes bugs. 
  Charlie joined Storitz because he loves small, smart teams, big competitive challenges, and the fact that we can deliver not just leads 
  but actual sales -- in the form of happy, signed-up customers -- to our wonderful clients. He believes Storitz is blazing a trail for the 
  next generation of local online e-commerce, and it's an exciting place to be. In his free time, his two young daughters tell him what do.</p>


  <h3>Jason Meade</h3>

  <p>Jason is a California native, born and raised in beautiful Southern
  California. He began his education as a liberal arts major, studying
  English Literature and French language, and was fortunate enough to
  study abroad in Paris as a college freshman. That experience was
  eye opening - too eye opening - and upon returning to the US, Jason dropped
  out of college and joined the Army, where he served in the Military
  Intelligence corps as a Signals Intelligence Analyst and Russian
  Linguist. It was also in the Army where he received his initial computer
  training, and got hooked on the programming bug!  Jason has worked in the 
  computer science field for more than twelve years, much of that in the 
  Internet and New Media arena. At Storitz, he cares for the website, and works 
  hard to give both our clients and our customers the best self-storage renting 
  experience possible.  Jason is excited to be a part of the Storitz team and 
  believes that self-storage is a vibrant, sexy, dynamic and exciting industry 
  that is beginning to come into its own, and we're privileged to be at the 
  forefront of this new wave.  In his spare time, Jason love to cook, and brew 
  a mean Vietnamese Cafe Phin Da! </p>

  <h3>Eric Morse</h3>
  <p>Eric was born and raised in rainy Seattle before fleeing to sunny Los Angeles for an undergraduate education at USC where he majored
  in Business Administration and was an active member in the Best Buddies program.  Previous to working at Storitz, Eric held positions 
  at a hospitality management firm working on their website, and at Microsoft in the global marketing department.  At Storitz, he procures 
  and manages new client relationships and also heads up the Storitz affiliate program.  It had always been a dream of Eric's to work for 
  a technology start-up, and he feels constantly inspired and motivated by the energy and ideas of his co-workers.  Outside of the office, 
  Eric enjoys playing tennis and basketball, reading non-ficition adventure books, traveling to see friends and family, and swimming in 
  the Pacific Ocean. </p>


  <h3>Gillian Singletary</h3>
  <p>Gillian grew up in beautiful Boulder, Colorado.  No, I know everyone says they grew up in "beautiful" wherever but Boulder is 
  seriously beautiful.  I mean, they didn't film Mork &amp; Mindy there for nothing.  She moved to Los Angeles (it's beautiful too, in its own
  way) to attend the beautiful University of Southern California and was so enamored by L.A. and all the, um, beauty, that she never left.  
  At Storitz, she manages the company's social media presence on all levels as well as staying on the cutting edge of social media and 
  nteractive marketing trends.  By the way have you ever seen The Cutting Edge?  That movie is fantastic. In addition to social media, 
  Gillian writes the Storitz blog and has gotten to utilize her penchant for wordplay to hone her copywriting skills on and off the Storitz 
  site.  Also she wrote this bio all by herself.  In her free time, she loves exploring Los Angeles, taking pictures of herself with 
  PhotoBooth, taking pictures of herself in photo booths, pretending that she's seen obscure films, riding on the metro, talking to her dog
  and refreshing her twitter feed.  Seriously, no one has @'d me today?  How is that possible??</p>

  <h3>Bill Soule</h3>
  <p>Bill Soule has over ten years of production experience in tv and social
  media. Bill began his career at ESPN where he cut baseball highlights and
  shoveled snow, lots of snow. Upon moving to LA he landed at E!
  Entertainment (where he wrote scripts profiling the boozy shenanigans of
  petulant celebutants) and transitioned to a career of online production,
  social media and SEO.  He watched from 3000 miles away as his beloved Red
  Sox immediately began their most successful decade in 100 years. But he
  did this with a smile on his face for it never snows in Santa Monica.</p>
