<h1>THE SMART AND EASY WAY TO FIND STORAGE</h1>

<p>When we founded this company, we decided to set some new standards for the way people find self storage.</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make a one-stop-shop for finding self storage</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Charge the lowest price possible</strong> for each storage unit</li>
  <li><strong>Let customers choose their storage unit from factual information</strong> and photos, not from a sales pitch, a pushy call center, or an annoyed storage manager</li>
  <li><strong>Allow customers to search based on location</strong>, using both a list and a map, because storage, like real estate, is all about location, location, location</li>
  <li><strong>Offer the most discounts, specials and promotions</strong> so the customer can choose which one is best for her</li>
  <li><strong>No additional fees to you</strong> (you’ll pay the same price to us that you would at the storage property or the storage property owner’s Website)</li>
</ul>
</p>
