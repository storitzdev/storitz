Making Purchases.</span> Please review the <span class="legalHeader">storage providerâ€™s Rental Agreement</span>, which will govern your rental of any storage space through the Site. If you wish to rent storage space described on the Site (each such purchase, a "Transaction"), you will be asked to supply certain information applicable to your Transaction, including, without limitation, credit card and other information. You understand that any such information will be treated by Storitz in the manner described in our Privacy Policy. You agree that all information that you provide in connection with your purchase will be accurate, current and complete. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you or any users of your account and credit card (or other applicable payment mechanism) at the price(s) in effect when such charges are incurred.

      <p>
        Descriptions or images of, or references to, products or services on the Site do not imply Storitz's endorsement of such products or services. We reserve the right, without prior notification, to change such descriptions or references; to honor, or impose conditions on the honoring of, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code or other similar promotions; to bar any user from making any or all Transaction(s); to limit the order quantity on any product or service; and/or to refuse to provide any user with any product or service.

Refunds and exchanges will be subject to Storitz's refund and exchange policies then in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="legalHeader">5. Information Provided by Storitz.</span> Although Storitz strives to provide Materials that are both useful and accurate, the nature of the data and other information contained on the Site is subject to frequent change. In addition, the facts and circumstances of every situation differ. Accordingly, although Storitz endeavors to use reasonable care in assembling the Materials, the Materials may not be up-to-date, accurate or complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, portions of the Materials have been contributed to the Site by various storage services providers and other persons. The inclusion of such information does not indicate any approval or endorsement thereof, and Storitz expressly disclaims any liability with respect to the foregoing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="legalHeader">6. Links.</span> The Site contains links to other Internet websites, including affiliated websites which may or may not be owned or operated by Storitz. Storitz has not reviewed all of the websites that are linked to the Site, and Storitz has no control over such sites. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, Storitz is not responsible for the content of such websites, any updates or changes to such sites, or the privacy or other practices of such sites, and the fact that Storitz offers such links does not indicate any approval or endorsement of any material contained on any linked site. Storitz is providing these links to you only as a convenience. Accordingly, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the terms of use and practices of any linked site. Further, it is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever links you select or software you download (whether from the Site or other sites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, defects, date bombs, time bombs and other items of a destructive nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF OTHER INTERNET WEBSITES AND RESOURCES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR USE OF ANY CONTENT, INFORMATION, DATA, ADVERTISING, PRODUCTS, OR OTHER MATERIALS ON OR AVAILABLE THROUGH SUCH WEBSITES AND RESOURCES, IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE APPLICABLE TO SUCH SITES AND RESOURCES.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="legalHeader">7. Claims of Copyright Infringement.</span> The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Storitz infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted by Storitz on one of our Forums), you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Storitz to locate the material on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Additionally, if you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by Storitz against you, the DMCA permits you to send Storitz a counter-notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <a href="http://www.loc.gov/copyright/">http://www.loc.gov/copyright/</a> for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to Copyright Officer, Storitz Inc., 2332 Cotner Avenue, Suite 302, Los Angeles, CA 90064.
        We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="legalHeader">8. Access By Minors.</span> Storitz cannot prohibit minors from visiting this site. Storitz must rely on parents, guardians and those responsible for supervising children under 13 to decide which materials are appropriate for such children to view and/or purchase. Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230 (d), as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available on the two websites GetNetWise (http://kids.getnetwise.org/) and OnGuard Online (http://onguardonline.gov/). Please note that Storitz does not endorse any of the products or services listed at such websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="legalHeader">9. Access from Outside the United States.</span> The Site is primarily directed to individuals residing in the United States. We make no representation that Materials available on or through the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Site and/or the provision of any service, program, film or other product described thereon to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion, and to limit the quantities of any such service, program, film or other product that we provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="legalHeader">10. Termination.</span> These Terms shall remain effective until terminated in accordance with its terms. We reserve the right to immediately terminate these Terms, and/or your access to and use of the Site or any portion thereof, at any time and for any reason, with or without cause. Upon termination of these Terms, your right to use the Site shall immediately cease, and you shall destroy all Materials obtained from the Site and all copies thereof, whether made under these Terms or otherwise. You agree that any termination of your access to or use of the Site may be effected without prior notice, and that Storitz may immediately deactivate or delete your password and user name, and all related information and files associated with it, and/or bar any further access to such information or files. You agree that Storitz shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Site or to any such information or files, and shall not be required to make such information or files available to you after any such termination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="legalHeader">11. Suspected Violation of these Terms or Law; Injunctive, Equitable Relief, and Liquidated Damages.</span> Violations of these Terms, including unauthorized use of the Site, may be investigated and appropriate legal action may be taken, including without limitation civil, criminal and injunctive redress. You understand and agree that in Storitz's sole discretion, and without prior notice, Storitz may terminate and block your access to the Site or to Storitz's other services, cancel your order or Transaction, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts Storitz believes may be associated with you, cancel any order associated with any person acting or believed to be acting in concert with you, remove any unauthorized Submissions or exercise any other remedy available, if Storitz believes that your conduct or the conduct of any person with whom Storitz believes you act in concert, or the Submissions you provide, violates or is inconsistent with these Terms or the law, or violates the rights of Storitz, a client of Storitz or another user of the Site. Violating any limitations or terms on the Site will be deemed to be a violation of these Terms. If we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide during any registration, ordering, purchase, sale, authentication, delivery, payment or remittance process, or any other process, or if we are no longer able to verify or authorize your credit card or bank account information, your order and/or Transaction may be cancelled, we may refuse to honor all pending and future purchases made on such credit card accounts and/or on any online accounts associated with such credit card accounts, and you may be prohibited from using the Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy to Storitz for violations of these Terms and you consent to injunctive or other equitable relief for such violations.
      </p>
      <p>
        You agree that abusive use of the Site, as defined above, causes damage and harm to Storitz in the form of, among other things, impaired goodwill, lost sales, and increased expenses associated with responding to abusive use of the Site. You further agree that monetary damages for abusive use of the Site are difficult to ascertain and that proof of monetary damages for abusive use would be costly and difficult to calculate. Accordingly you agree that liquidated damages are warranted for abusive use. Therefore, you agree that if you, or others acting in concert with you, alone or collectively request more than 1,000 pages of the Site in any twenty-four hour period, you, and those acting in concert with you, will be jointly and severally liable for liquidated damages in the amount of twenty-five cents ($0.25) per page request each time that a page request is made after that first 1000 during that twenty-four hour period. You also agree that this will be the measure of damages for any abusive use that occurred prior to this provision of these Terms being in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Storitz is not required to provide any refund to you if it exercises any of its rights or remedies because you have violated these Terms or any of Storitz's rights. Additionally, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice to you. We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to impose limits on certain features and services and to restrict access to any part or to all of the Site without notice to you. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any claim or cause of action arising out of our exercise of the foregoing rights.
